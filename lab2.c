//1 The extra step we take is adding 1 to our complemented(flipping bits) number.
//2-1. 10111
//2-2. 10101
//2-3. 11001
//2-4. 11111
//3.
//4.  In 2’s complement we have only one way to represent 0
//5 we need to convert decimal 7 to binary
//6 we need to convert decimal 7 to binary and do one’s complement, then plus 1 to the binary
//7. If the decimal is positive number, you just need to convert it to binary.if it’s negative number, follow the same flow as the above and then plus 1 from the binary number.
